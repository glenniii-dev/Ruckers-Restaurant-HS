		<h3>Rucker's Backstory</h3>
		<h4>Ruckers Restaurant was founded in 1975 by Johnathan and Julie Rucker. 
		Johnathan had grown up cooking in the kitchen with his mother. When he finished school
		he decided he was going to save up money to buy his own restaurant. He worked
		tirelessly everyday at other restaurants as a cook. He was earning money and
		was learning about how to run a restaurant. One day while working he met Julie Harper. 
		Years later they got married. They kept saving hoping to have enough one day to buy 
		there own restaurant. In all the restaurants they worked at they noticed that the enviroment 
		wasnt always calm, quiet, and family friendly.<br /><br /> On the sunny spring day of 
		April 23, 1975 they earned enough to buy there own restaurant! One month later 
		they bought a restaurant soon to be Ruckers. Unlike the restaurants they worked at they 
	    resolved to keep there restaurant always calm, and family friendly with a professional waitstaff.
		On August 1, 1975 Ruckers was established. Months later they had Jeff Rucker.<br /><br />
		Today almost 50 years later Rucker's is still going and is under the third-generation ownership 
		of Johnathan and Julie Ruckers grandson John Rucker.</h4>
